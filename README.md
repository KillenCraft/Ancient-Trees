"In the time before The Fall, the world was vibrant, teeming with life. The Fall changed the world and only a
portion of what was has survived.

"In their wisdom, the Ancient Ones foresaw the Extinction and took steps to preserve trees within chests hidden in the
world. It is tragic that, for all the good they did, the Ancient Ones could not save themselves..."

Ancient Trees adds thirteen species of extinct trees to the world. You may find the rare saplings in chests hidden
throughout the land. You can find them and restore the species... Each species can be used to make the full range of
woodcraft. ([screen shots](screen-shots.md))
